## Data Sources
- Primary crime dataset: Crime Data from 2020 to Present (Los Angeles City)
- Major events data: Los Angeles Times
- Population data: U.S. Census Bureau
- Employment and income data: LA Neighborhood Data
- LAPD regions data: LAPD Official Website

## Key Findings

### 1. Overall Crime Trends
- 2022 recorded the highest number of crimes
- Notable increase in crime rates post-COVID lockdowns
- Vehicle theft consistently ranks as the top reported offense

### 2. Regional Analysis
- Central region shows highest crime count (54,556 in 2021)
- Notable correlation between economic factors and crime rates:
  - Higher median household income â†’ Lower crime rates
  - Higher unemployment rates â†’ Higher crime rates

### 3. Temporal Patterns
- Peak crime hours: Afternoon
- Highest crime day: Friday
- Seasonal peaks during summer months
- New Year's Day consistently shows spike in crime rates

### 4. Demographic Insights
- Age distribution: 20-40 years most frequent
- Gender analysis: Slightly higher male victimization
- Exception: Identity theft shows higher female victimization

## Data Cleaning Process
1. Date and time formatting
   - Standardized date formats
   - Converted 24-hour time format
2. Missing data handling
   - Standardized gender categories (M, F, X)
   - Addressed age inconsistencies
3. Duplicate removal and outlier handling
4. Data type standardization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Prophet for time series forecasting
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations
- GeoPandas for geographical analysis

## Model Performance
Prophet Model Metrics:
- MAE: 5.34
- MAPE: 0.091
- RMSE: 76.40

## Key Visualizations
1. Crime Rate Distribution Map
2. Time Series Analysis Plots
3. Demographic Distribution Charts
4. Economic Correlation Plots

## Future Work
- Integration of additional demographic factors
- Enhanced predictive modeling
- Real-time data integration capabilities
- Deeper analysis of specific crime categories
